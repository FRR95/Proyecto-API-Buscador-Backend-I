## Bugs üêõ

**When i run the seeders an error appears and says:**
```sh
throw new CannotExecuteNotConnectedError(this.name)
                  ^
CannotExecuteNotConnectedError: Cannot execute operation on "default" connection because connection is not yet established.
```

**The connection is stablished and the seeder is succesfully executed anyway despite the error**
